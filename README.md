# cs-code-challenge-ibm-2
This is the Solution 2 of the IBM ANF CS Code Challenge.

#To run this solution open any IDE (preferrably Eclipse) and attach any server available to you (eg - Apache Tomcat)
#Import the .html, .js and .css files into your Dynamic Web Project and start the server.
#You will find the demo result at probably a link like this - "https://localhost:8080/TestProject/index.html" where the "TestProject" is the <Name> of your own Dynamic Web Project and the Port of 8080 may vary as per the available free port at your end.

#Key features -

1. The solution has been made responsive as per suggestion.
2. The entire codebase has been re-structured as per efficiency.
3. Global scope pollution of JS has been reduced by the use of IIFE and best practices of loading enhanced like <script defer src="..."></script> have been used to enhance the performance.
4. The entire CSS changes have been done as asked using Flexbox only and not using the Grid pattern or Bootstrap columns etc.
5. Minimal changes on the code base have been done to retain its original essence.
6. LocalStorage has been used to hold on to the values saved in the form and that will continue to hold the value till the LocalStorage is erased.
